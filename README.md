Computer Exercise 3

Testbench Results for the Mealy Machine:
![Mealy] (https://raw.github.com/John-Rios/ECE281_CE3/master/Mealy_Sim_Results.JPG)
These results are correct because they behave as expected according to the testbanch. The testbench was written in order to test the situation presented in step seven of the CE3 handout. The simulation results are the desired outcomes as the VHDL produces the proper outputs and the testbench simulation results match the given image in the CE3 handout. These results suggest the mealy machine VHDL code is correct. 


Testbench Results for the Moore Machine:
![Moore] (https://raw.github.com/John-Rios/ECE281_CE3/master/Moore_Sim_Results.JPG)
These results are correct because they behave as expected according to the testbanch. The testbench was written in order to test the situation presented in step seven of the CE3 handout. The simulation results are the desired outcomes as the VHDL produces the proper outputs and the testbench simulation results match the given image in the CE3 handout. These results suggest the moore machine VHDL code is correct. 

Answers to the questions in the VHDL shells:
-Question:
-Question:

Debugging: 
  I encountered several errors and issues while attampting to complete this computer exercise. I will begin with the erros from the moore machine design and code. After writing the VHDL code, the simulation results showed that the elevator would go travel up to the fourth floor properly and then stay there infinitely.
